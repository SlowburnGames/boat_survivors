      get closer, you realize it's a young, seemingly innocent girl. \r\nBut there's
      something about her that makes you feel uneasy. It probably has something to
      with the fact that she is wearing a gas mask and carrying\r\na creepy teddybear
      around with her...\r\n\r\n\"Please help me, I'm all alone and scared.\"\r\n\r\nHer
      voice is trembling. Still, you can't seem to shake that weird feeling that
      something might be wrong...\r\nYou and your crew exchange glances, unsure of
      what to do."
