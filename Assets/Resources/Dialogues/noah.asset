    DialogueText: 'You see pile of rags resting on an improvised vessel. As our ship
      comes closer you think the pile begins to move. Long frail arms crawl out underneath
      the rags reaching out to the ship.

      The arms resemble bones, not only
      in their meager appearance but also for their pale skin. An seemingly ancient
      man greets with a genuinely kind but strange smile on his face.'

    DialogueText: While the lunatic is becomes merely a small figure on the horizon,
      you can still hear his senseless rambling and occasionally shouting things
      sounding like curses. You hope this unsettling encounter soon becomes a distant
      memory the more miles we bring between him and us.
