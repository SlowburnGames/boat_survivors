  - DialogueText: "Carlos and Dominic, the siblings are so exited that you join them,
      that it is hard for you to understand what the are saying. After some time
      you thing you can see the green spot as well. You give the order to navigate
      straight Carlos and Dominic\u2019s spot on the horizon. Coming closer, you
      see that the green spot is actually a rather small but unbelievably lush and
      green island. But something is off. Many of the bushes seem trampled, the ground
      dug up and cracked branches everywhere.. amidst the chaos stands a tall man,
      his shoulders moved by his heavy breathing. Hectically looking around the man\u2019s
      eyes lock onto you.. then you see it. Another person, bleeding and seemingly
      unconscious laying right in front of the hectic man\u2019s feet. At this very
      moment the tall man begins to charge at you and your crew."

  - DialogueText: The tall man runs at first person he sees, which is you and grabs
      you. You try to parry is hands. He is incredibly strong. Two crewmates come
      to your assistance. Together you are able to release the grip of the tall man
      but all four tumble and fall. You look up but can not see the tall man, looking
      around you notice that all the people run to the handrails and look into the
      dark ocean. He fell into the water and he is not coming up to to breath again.
      Then you send someone to check for the injured person on the beach, but it
      was already too late.

  - DialogueText: You try to calm the hectic man. The tall man grabs you, his grip
      is terrifyingly strong, like a machine. He shakes you and points at the beach
      but does not speak a single word. After a few moments Carlos, one of the children
      on the ship says he might want to show you something. You and a couple of other
      interested people follow the tall man to where he was pointing. The injured
      person on the beach. The tall man bows down to the injured person, now looking
      almost regular sized to you, and looks with helping eyes into your groups direction.
      No words needed. All of you work together to help bring the two men on board
      and give both medical attention.
