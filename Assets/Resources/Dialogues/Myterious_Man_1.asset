  - DialogueText: The mysterious man sharply twists his head to look you directly
      into the eyes. This moment seems to last forever. He throws a sack or something
      wrapped in cloth on board, which quickly garners the attention of most of the
      crew on board. You take a look at the package, it contains technical equipment
      . Surprised you raise your head and want to say something to the mysterious
      man, but he is gone.
